The idea of Dog Social was concieved after taking my dogs on pack walks where the goal is to get dogs who are over stimulated around other dogs more comfortable in settings where they may be exposed to other dogs. The dogs on the pack walk are required to wear a certain color ribbon based on their approachability by other dogs. A dog with a green ribbon is friendly and approachable. If a dog has a yellow ribbon it means to be cautious and ask the owner because the dog may have their moments of being on guard. If a dog wears a red ribbon it means they are not approachable. With Dog Social owners who go to parks to walk or spend time with their dogs can be aware of other dogs throughout the park and make other owners aware of their dogs whereabouts and approachability.

Dog Social is a CRUD app where a user can create a post on the main feed page that lists their dogs name, approachability, location and whether their dog is leashed or not. In the dog show page the owner can update if the dog leash status, select to post in the main feed if the dog is lost, edit information in their post, post a comment or delete their post. Users who are not related to the dog can view can go to the show view page to view the content not in the main feed such as dog owners name and comments. While a logged in user can add comments to another dogs show page.
